This repository contains personal contributions to the TensorLy Quantum library. It includes new operators and gates employed in the study
variational quantum algorithms.

The tlquantum_added folder contains the equivalent of the tlquantum folder installed with TensorLy Quantum, but including these new gates and operators.
